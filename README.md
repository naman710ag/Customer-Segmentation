# Customer-Segmentation
The basis of the project is to classify the customer data on the basis of cluster data that the e commerce can take on the basis of sales data. This will allow the organization to customize services and products for the segment.
In this project, supervised learning algorithms have been taken and are compared with each other to know which model is the best that can be taken by the business.
